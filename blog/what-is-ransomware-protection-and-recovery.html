                    <p>Ransomware attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency, posing a significant threat to organizations of all sizes. This article explores comprehensive strategies for protecting against, detecting, containing, and recovering from ransomware attacks in the current threat landscape.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Evolving Ransomware Threat</h2>
                    <p>Modern ransomware attacks have evolved from simple encryption schemes to multi-faceted extortion operations. Today's attackers often employ a "double extortion" approach, where they not only encrypt data but also exfiltrate sensitive information and threaten to leak it unless a ransom is paid. Some have even advanced to "triple extortion," adding DDoS attacks or targeting customers as additional pressure tactics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Key trends in the ransomware landscape include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) models lowering the barrier to entry for attackers</li>
                        <li>Targeted attacks focusing on critical infrastructure and high-value targets</li>
                        <li>Supply chain compromises affecting multiple organizations simultaneously</li>
                        <li>Human-operated ransomware with attackers manually navigating networks</li>
