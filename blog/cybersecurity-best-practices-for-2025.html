                    <p>As we navigate through 2025, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Ransomware attacks, supply chain compromises, and sophisticated nation-state operations have reached unprecedented levels of sophistication. This article outlines the essential security practices that organizations should implement to protect their digital assets in this challenging environment.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. Implement Zero Trust Architecture</h2>
                    <p>The traditional perimeter-based security model is no longer sufficient. Zero Trust assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network, operating on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Key components include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identity-based access:</strong> Verify every user and device attempting to access resources, regardless of location</li>
                        <li><strong>Micro-segmentation:</strong> Divide networks into isolated segments to contain breaches</li>
                        <li><strong>Least privilege access:</strong> Grant users only the permissions necessary for their specific role</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous verification:</strong> Authenticate and authorize users consistently throughout their session</li>
                        <li><strong>Device health validation:</strong> Verify security posture before granting access to resources</li>
                    </ul>
