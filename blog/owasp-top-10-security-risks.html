                    <p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security practitioners. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. This article explores the current OWASP Top 10 list, explaining each risk and providing guidance on how to mitigate them.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. Broken Access Control</h2>
                    <p>Access control enforces policies such that users cannot act outside their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of data.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Common vulnerabilities include:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Violation of the principle of least privilege</li>
                        <li>Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL or HTML page</li>
                        <li>Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account by providing its unique identifier</li>
                        <li>Accessing API without access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE</li>
                        <li>Elevation of privilege (acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Prevention measures:</strong></p>

                        <li>Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records</li>
                        <li>Use input validation with allowlist approach</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>4. Insecure Design</h2>
                    <p>Insecure design refers to flaws in the design and architecture of applications, as distinct from implementation flaws. It involves failures in threat modeling, secure design patterns, and proper security requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Common vulnerabilities include:</strong></p>
